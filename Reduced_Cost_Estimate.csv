AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.

To reduce the costs I selected to use EC2 savings plans for a 1 year reservation with no upfront cost. Additionally i have selected a lower tier EC2 instance size of the same type which still should be sufficient to handle the load on average and on peaks. To further decrease the costs I decided to use Linux Instances instead of Windows instances which incurrs reduced charges due to slightly lower license fees.
